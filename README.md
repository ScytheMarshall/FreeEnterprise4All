# FF4FE Perfected

This is a fork of the open-source version of Free Enterprise 4.x.  Logic has been revised because the only way is to fade the TwinHarp, among other things.

## Setup

Instructions at the main FreeEnterprise4 github.

## Contributors

Free Enterprise was made possible using the extensive technical research and knowledge of PinkPuff, Grimoire LD, Chillyfeez, and Aexoden. This repo contains code written and designed by b0ardface/HungryTenor, Crow, Myself086, Myria, mxzv, and Wylem. It also contains the graphic design work of SchalaKitty and Steph Sybydlo. It is based on the game design work of riversmccown and mxzv. And while their specific assets are not included in this repo, the musical work of Xenocat and Calmlamity contributes extensively to Free Enterprise, and was formative in the development of tools contained here.
