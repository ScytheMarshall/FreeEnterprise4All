# FF4FE Perfected

This is a fork of the open-source version of Free Enterprise 4.x.  Logic has been revised because the only way is to fade the TwinHarp, among other things.

This will be messy, as I have no idea what I'm doing.

## Hopes and Dreams

Currently working on some gameplay and logic changes.

- Removing Cave Magnes from KI pool entirely, replacing it with Rydia's Mom.  Knofree is removed as a result.
- Safeguard the FreeEn channel by removing Adamant Armor from Pink Puff drop table.
- Removing Pkey.  Don't worry, it can still be had on Pnone.  **puff puff pass**
- Removing corner case scenarios (D.Mist at Rubi gating Magma Key on force:hook, Odin gating Magma as sole underground access on Bvanilla)

Here is what I would like to try to implement:

- Omode:harp
- More terrible and not terrible harp music and maybe some new versions of classics.  Provisions for -harp:vanilla and -harp:safe are planned (naming is tentative)
- New Z-sprites
- Meaner monsters in Magnes
- Options for FF4J and FF4 Easytype monster stats and scripts.  

Super long-term goals would include transforming Cave Magnes into an overly impossible dungeon.

## Contributors

Free Enterprise was made possible using the extensive technical research and knowledge of PinkPuff, Grimoire LD, Chillyfeez, and Aexoden. This repo contains code written and designed by b0ardface/HungryTenor, Crow, Myself086, Myria, mxzv, and Wylem. It also contains the graphic design work of SchalaKitty and Steph Sybydlo. It is based on the game design work of riversmccown and mxzv. And while their specific assets are not included in this repo, the musical work of Xenocat and Calmlamity contributes extensively to Free Enterprise, and was formative in the development of tools contained here.
